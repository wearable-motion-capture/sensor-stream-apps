# Sensor Stream Apps

This repository is part of our [__wearable motion capture system__](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture). 

Here, we provide two apps for smart devices. One Android app for smartphones and one Wear OS app for smartwatches.
Together with [arm-pose-estimation](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture/arm-pose-estimation),
these apps enable data transfer from smart devices to a remote system through UDP streams via a local network.

## Compatible Devices

The apps are at least compatible with Android 11.0 (Watch App) and Android 10.0 (Phone App).
They have been tested on:
