# Sensor Stream Apps

This repository is part of the [wearable motion capture](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture) framework. Here, we provide two apps for smart devices. One Android app for smartphones and one Wear OS app for smartwatches. Together with [arm-pose-estimation](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture/arm-pose-estimation),
these apps enable data transfer from smart devices to a remote system through UDP streams via a local network.
